Eventually, she was able to get her ex-friend to admit to killing patients by injecting lethal doses of insulin and heart medications into their IV bags.</p><p>The Good Nurse, starring Jessica Chastain as Loughren and Eddie Redmayne as Cullen, is based on the true story of how Loughren put an end to Cullen’s murdering spree.
