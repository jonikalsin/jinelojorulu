I have pictures of him smiling, and I think I’m sensing that he’s in a good place. I do.”</p><p>Turner described her son as “introverted” and “very shy.”</p><p><strong>she said-</strong></p><p>“I didn’t know either, except now when I listen back to our last conversations, I notice a change. The last few times we talked, the conversations were different, and I didn’t know that until after the sμicide.”</p><p>After Craig pἀssed away, Turner scattered his<strong> ashes in the Pacific Ocean</strong>.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Craig-Turner-Cause-of-Deἀth-2.webp alt="Craig Turner Cause of Deἀth" width=1200 height=628 title="Craig Turner Cause of Death: The Unspoken Truth of Her Demise Revealed!" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>The singer wrote in a Twitter tribute to her son-</strong></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>My saddest moment as a mother.
