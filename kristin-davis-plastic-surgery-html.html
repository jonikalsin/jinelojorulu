Her performance in the series also helped her earn&nbsp;nominations at the Emmys and the Golden Globes. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>After the series went off-air in 2004, she reprised the role&nbsp;in&nbsp;Sex and the City (2008) and Sex and the City 2 (2010). Davis'&nbsp;other notable acting&nbsp;endeavors include&nbsp;Melrose Place, Couples Retreat, Jack and Jill, and Miss Spider's Sunny Patch Friends.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Besides her work, the 56-year-old actress has also been in the news for various rumors of her getting plastic surgery. Several online outlets have even compared her pictures, discussing her before and after plastic surgery looks. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>But has&nbsp;Davis been under the knife?</p><h2>Fans Claimed Kristin Davis Looked ‘Unrecognizable’ in New HBO Spinoff Trailer</h2><p>HBO recently dropped the trailer for the comedy-drama series&nbsp;And Just Like That,&nbsp;a 10-episode revival of Sex and the City. In the trailer, the original cast members made their appearance — and&nbsp;Davis was one of them.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>But fans were <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">quick to claim</a> that the actress had performed plastic surgery on her face, with many viewers pointing she looked "unrecognizable" in the trailer. Some also questioned whether her altered appearance was the result of cosmetic work. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"And just like that, Charlotte has a new face," a viewer wrote. Another chimed, "What did Charlotte do to her face?"</p><p>Someone tweeted, "I completely understand the pressure women are under to look a certain way, and will likely have plastic surgery myself if I have the resources. That said, Kristin Davis looks like she ingested Smylex."</p><p>"Every time they show Kristin Davis's face for #AndJustLikeThat, I wonder how much she paid for such awful plastic surgery. She was such a natural beauty before," another person tweeted, with one of their followers replying, "It’s literally ALL I can see." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Kristin Davis Previously Said She Didn’t Want Plastic Surgery</h2><p>So far, Davis — or any verified source — has not confirmed if the actress recently went under the knife. The only people to claim such&nbsp;are netizens and some online outlets, who have no proof.</p><p>But back in 2018, during an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview with New Beauty</a>, she completely denied&nbsp;getting plastic surgery and implied she wouldn't get it in the future.</p><p>The actress stated that she was "scared of needles, scared of complications and scared of doing something that looks bad and not being able to go back and fix it." Because of those reasons, she said she didn't want to alter the way she looked surgically. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Keeping the idea of plastic surgery away, she instead started&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">hitting the gym</a> six days a week — which she admitted the same year while speaking with&nbsp;AOL. She said she was trying to change her body after realizing the need to be healthy. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>During the conversation, she further shared that beauty standards did concern her, and she did think about them. However,&nbsp;she felt stronger in who she was and always loved her body.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKOinsC1tc1mm5qumah6sbjArKuim12owrOzxKuwZ6Ckork%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-is-brad-james-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How Much Is Brad James Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./darby-wheeler-obituary-has-tragically-passed-away-in-oklahoma-city-ok-death-the-world-obits.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Darby Wheeler Obituary, Has Tragically Passed Away In Oklahoma City, OK Death The world obit</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carson-daly.html>Carson Daly - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Nationality, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-the-mike-tyson-vs-jake-paul-fight-the-most-hyped-sporting-event-of-2024.html>Is the Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul Fight the Most Hyped Sporting Event of 2024?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-are-the-top-highest-paid-college-athletes-in-2023.html>Who are the top highest paid college athletes in 2023?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-can-i-watch-the-ncaa-football-championship-2024.html>How can I watch the NCAA football Championship 2024?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sheryl-lee-ralph.html>Sheryl Lee Ralph Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
