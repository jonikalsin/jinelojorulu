I can’t even find my wallet three times a week.”</p><p>The Hollywood star joked that parents in attendance had “really messed up” and could find themselves “supporting these kids for a very long time”.</p><p>He quipped: “They are not leaving the nest anytime soon. This is a tough business they chose, but there’s still time to talk them out of it.”</p><p>The ‘Uncut Gems’ actor added that he was trying to talk his daughters Sadie, 16, and Sunny, 13, out of a career in showbiz despite their famous dad.</p><p>He also noted he had “two pieces of advice” for parents at the first ceremony, as he found time to poke fun at both filmmaker Martin Scorsese and Oscar-winner Leonardo DiCaprio.</p><p>He said: “Number one, somehow slip your kid’s headshot to Mr. Martin Scorsese before this event ends; he’ll love it, I promise.</p><p>“He’s probably gonna take the back exit out of here, so make sure you get there before he does.</p><p>“And do not take no for an answer – that’s how Leo’s mom did it.”</p><p>Elsewhere in his speech, Sandler advised the graduates that “some will get to their goals quickly, some might take a bit to get there” and “some will change goals and say, ‘F*** it, I’m gonna be an agent'”.</p><p>He also found time to joke about the thoughts that must be running through the graduates’ head during such an intimidating time in their lives.</p><p>He teased: “Is school really over? What the hell do I do with my life now? I’ve never been this hungover before.</p><p>“If I throw up in my cap, will anybody notice? I hope my parents don’t expect me to pay for lunch after this. I can’t believe my father is still looking for a parking spot.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOmpuapV2orq%2Bwy56pZqKfoLK0ecCbpq6sXZius7HEq2Sipl2Wv7W%2FjJ2sq6GenHqku8ymnKeblaKyr8CMrKeenZOdeqe70Waeq5mUqq61sdJo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./amy-nickerson-obituary.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Amy Nickerson Obituary: Longtime Native Of Searsmont, Maine, Has Tragically Died</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./wow-10-2-release-date.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>WoW 10.2 Release Date: The Epic Zone Arrives!</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carson-daly.html>Carson Daly - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Nationality, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-the-mike-tyson-vs-jake-paul-fight-the-most-hyped-sporting-event-of-2024.html>Is the Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul Fight the Most Hyped Sporting Event of 2024?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-are-the-top-highest-paid-college-athletes-in-2023.html>Who are the top highest paid college athletes in 2023?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-can-i-watch-the-ncaa-football-championship-2024.html>How can I watch the NCAA football Championship 2024?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sheryl-lee-ralph.html>Sheryl Lee Ralph Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
