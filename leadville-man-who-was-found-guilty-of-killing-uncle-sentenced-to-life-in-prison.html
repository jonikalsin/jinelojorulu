When they arrived, they <a class=Link href=#>found Flores deceased in his home</a>. Deputies saw signs of a struggle in the home.</p><p>Flores had been the owner of Pro-Electric, Inc. in the Leadville area for more than 10 years.</p><p>The sheriff’s office began a homicide investigation with help from the district attorney’s office and the Colorado Bureau of Investigation.</p><p>Denver 7+ Colorado News Latest Headlines | August 1, 8am</p><p>During the investigation, authorities learned that on Sept. 2, 2020, Flores welcomed co-workers and friends over to his home. Gurule attended the party, according to the district attorney’s office. Another co-worker, who had gone to the home and left around 7 p.m., said Flores was hanging out with Gurule, who also worked at Pro-Electric, and two others when he left. They were drinking.</p><p>The following morning, Flores did not show up to work. The co-worker who left the party at 7 p.m. the night prior went to Flores’ home, where he found broken objects, holes in the wall, cabinet doors ripped off the hinges and other damage. He also found Flores dead in his bathroom. The co-worker then called 911, according to the district attorney’s office.</p><p>During the subsequent investigation, authorities spoke with two other people who stayed at the party past 7 p.m. They said Gurule “flipped a switch” and became confrontational, so they left the home, leaving only Flores and Gurule inside, according to the district attorney’s office.</p><p>Deputies also spoke with Gurule, who said he woke up the next morning in his own bed with dried blood on his nose and hands. He said he didn’t remember what happened the night before, according to the district attorney’s office.</p><p>During an interview with CBI, he had a swollen right hand, scratches on his arms, side and back, and bruises on his knee. He also had a contusion on the left side of his forehead.</p><p>Flores’ cause of death was determined to be severe blunt force craniocerebral injuries, according to a pathologist. Rib fractures were a significant contributor. The pathologist said strangulation could not be ruled out.</p><p><a class=Link href=#>Gurule was arrested</a> on Sept. 4.</p><p>A jury deliberated for a few hours before <a class=Link href=# rel=noopener>they found him guilty in June</a>, according to the 5th Judicial District Attorney’s Office.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnnJqupcLIpaOeZZ2Wu27Dx6hksJmjYrOwwc2dZKCtmaHBunnOn2SkoZyhtq%2BzjK6lnKSVYsCmutOepZydlGLBsHnLop2eZZmjerG%2ByKymp2c%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./discovering-sistine-stallone-age-biography-height-movies-and-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Discovering Sistine Stallone: Age, Biography, Height, Movies, and Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./cindy-kimberly-height.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Cindy Kimberly Height</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carson-daly.html>Carson Daly - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Nationality, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-the-mike-tyson-vs-jake-paul-fight-the-most-hyped-sporting-event-of-2024.html>Is the Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul Fight the Most Hyped Sporting Event of 2024?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-are-the-top-highest-paid-college-athletes-in-2023.html>Who are the top highest paid college athletes in 2023?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-can-i-watch-the-ncaa-football-championship-2024.html>How can I watch the NCAA football Championship 2024?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sheryl-lee-ralph.html>Sheryl Lee Ralph Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
