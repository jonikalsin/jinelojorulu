He was awarded the Tony for his contribution to the musical Parade which was inspired by the lynchings of Jewish factor worker&nbsp;He won a Tony for his work on the musical Parade, which was based on the lynching of Jewish factor worker <a href=#>Leo Frank</a>..</p><p>Brown was subsequently hired to write songs for the Broadway musical Parade, based on the trial and lynching of Leo Frank, after meeting Hal Prince. Parade, directed by Prince and with a book by Alfred Uhry, won Brown the 1999 Tony Award for Best Original Score. During this production, Livent, one of the producers of Parade, pulled out after reviews were not as positive as they’d hoped. RCA Victor, the other major producer, decided it would pull out as well. Brown said of the event in 1999, “Livent dropped out shortly after the reviews came out. They announced they would not spend another dime on the show. RCA had an agreement to record all of Livent’s shows. But when Livent pulled out of ‘Parade,’ the RCA higher-ups said they were pulling out, too. I had to go to Billy Rosenfield and ask him: ‘What if we pay for this record and you just distribute it?’ Billy said, ‘Sure.'” Brown had to try to scrounge money from every corner, “In the end, RCA put in $25,000, Lincoln Center put in a big chunk, around $200,000, including the producer Scott Rudin’s $25,000, and there was a contribution from the Gilman and Gonzalez-Falla foundation, which has helped support a lot of musical theatre composers over the years, of $40,000. Even Roy Furman, the new guy at Livent, gave us a little money. Somehow, we pulled it together.” Livent also was struggling at the time because the company had mishandled funds while applying for bankruptcy protection.</p><p>Brown was born in Ossining, New York.
