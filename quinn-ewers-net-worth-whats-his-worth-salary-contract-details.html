Ewers had inked the pact with Ohio before joining Texas in 2022. The deals have been flowing for the teenager since he signed the hefty contract in 2021. He was formerly one of the highest-paid football college players, but his earnings have declined in recent years.</p><p>The Longhorns quarterback faces competition from his colleague Arch Manning, as well as Shedeur Sanders and Travis Hunter. Earlier this year, the 20-year-old signed with Panini America and c4 Energy. Ewers is presently out due to a shoulder injury sustained against the Houston Cougars. Texas Coach Steve Sarkisian said that Quinn was making progress, but it is unclear when he would return to the team.</p><h2>Quinn Ewers Net Worth: NIL Deal</h2><p><strong>Quinn Ewers</strong>, the Texas Longhorns quarterback, allegedly has a net worth of $1 million. In 2021, the 20-year-old agreed to a $1.4 million NIL deal.&nbsp;The Action Network’s sports business expert Darren Rovell broke the news on X (previously Twitter), reporting that the athlete autograph company GTSM secured a contract with Ewers, who had graduated from high school a year earlier and reclassified into the Class of 2021.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Quinn-Ewers.jpg alt="Quinn Ewers" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>It was Ewers’ second NIL agreement at the time, after his first with Texas-based Holy Kombucha. Last year, Yahoo! stated that Ewers’ NIL agreement was reaching $4 million, but this was due to the commencement of an NFT campaign.&nbsp;However, by 2023, the buzz around NFT has waned, with many sportsmen and celebrities, including Justin Bieber and Logan Paul, losing respect for NFT partnerships. Yahoo! also stated that Ewers supporters had to pay a $30 initial membership fee, which could rise to $500. These partnerships would allow fans to get future special NFT drops and autographed artifacts.</p><p>Ewers signed with GTSM while with Ohio, and after going to Texas, he has inked additional agreements, including one with Wrangler jeans. In 2022, he uploaded an Instagram photo endorsing the jeans with the statement, “My first pair of jeans were Wrangler, and I have been wearing them ever since.”&nbsp;Quinn Ewers was one of the top ten CFB players on the NIL list in 2021 when he received his first contract. However, in recent years, players like Shedeur Sanders, Arch Manning, and Caleb Williams have taken control.</p><h2>Quinn Ewers Signs With Panini: Contract Detail</h2><p>Earlier this year, Quinn Ewers landed a huge contract with Panini America, the world’s leading sports and entertainment collectibles firm.&nbsp;The arrangement with Panini involves just signed trading cards, and the quarterback announced it on X. He released a 45-second video of himself hitting the field at Darrell K Royal Memorial Stadium, along with shots of supporters cheering him on.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Quinn-Ewers-2.jpg alt="Quinn Ewers" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>His tweet was titled, “Excited to announce that I’ve signed an exclusive autograph trading card deal with Panini America.”&nbsp;After signing with Panini America, Ewers joined Ausar Thompson, Charles Barkley, David Beckham, Christian Pulisic, and Kylian Mbappe. A week after signing with Panini, his buddy Arch Manning followed suit.&nbsp;Arch Manning has an advantage against Ewers since his NIL contract is worth $2.8 million. Manning ranks second behind Shedeur Sanders among college football players and fourth overall.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiorqGeo3qmw8Srqmamlal6uLvRrZ9mr5iWwbR5x6KqZq%2Bfp8GpedKao5qqqWKwsLrTq5icrF2ZsrWtyKWqaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./westfield-teen-victim-of-deepfake-porn-pleads-with-lawmakers-it-could-happen-to-anyone.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Westfield Teen Victim Of Deepfake Porn Pleads With Lawmakers: 'It Could Happen To Anyone'</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./paula-pritchett-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Paula Pritchett Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carson-daly.html>Carson Daly - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Nationality, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-the-mike-tyson-vs-jake-paul-fight-the-most-hyped-sporting-event-of-2024.html>Is the Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul Fight the Most Hyped Sporting Event of 2024?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-are-the-top-highest-paid-college-athletes-in-2023.html>Who are the top highest paid college athletes in 2023?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-can-i-watch-the-ncaa-football-championship-2024.html>How can I watch the NCAA football Championship 2024?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sheryl-lee-ralph.html>Sheryl Lee Ralph Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
