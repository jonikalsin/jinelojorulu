Just beyond is a <a href=#>horror-comedy series</a> inspired by the novel with the same name written by R.L. Stine. The series employs supernatural powers to explain the challenges faced by the youths daily. Some of the issues it focuses on are anxiety, peer pressure and bullying, which is rampant in <a href=#>schools</a>. It plays a major role in challenging the minds of the viewers without overwhelming them. All the episodes in this series involve the alliances of supernatural beings: <a href=#>witches</a>, ghosts, and <a href=#>aliens</a>. As terrifying as the series is, it is the start of a beautiful self-discovery journey. Amazing right?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Just Beyond Season 1 Recap: What happened in the first season?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/besttoppers.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/just-beyond-recap.jpg><p>Each episode employs a terrifying antic in telling a story. In the first episode of this story, we see Veronica being sent to Miss Genevieve’s school. The school is for tough girls. It is soon made clear that discipline has its bad side. Lily is also seen struggling to make people see her outer beauty than her wits.</p><p>This makes the viewers contemplate if the physical attributes are better than the inner qualities. In the season’s finale, the pain Sam feels when he falls into a treehouse determines the choices he makes. Given that Stine has written many <a href=#>books</a>, running short on content to produce is almost impossible. The producers will not have a hard time coming up with the second series of this film.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Just Beyond Season 1 Rating: Is the Series Worth Watching?</h2><p>Just Beyond is an anthology series on Disney+ that is based on the graphic novel by R.

This means this series has different genres and characters in every episode; however, this is not always the case in every anthology series, such as the “Four Star Playhouse,” where the same actors were hired to play different roles in different dramas.</p><p>If ever we were to have a Season 2 we can expect these main characters: Lauren Lindzey (Donzis), <a href=#>Ghostbusters: Afterlife</a> star McKenna Grace (Veronica), Izabela Vidovic (Lily), Nasim Pedrad (miss Genevieve), Cedric Joe (Sam), Lexi Underwood (Ella), Malcolm Beretta (Andy) and Emily Plamer (Rose).
