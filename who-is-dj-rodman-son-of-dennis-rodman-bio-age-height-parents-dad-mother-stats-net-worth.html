shooting, and great potential in skills like ball handling and quickness.</p><h4><strong>DJ Rodman brief bio</strong></h4><p>DJ Rodman, full name, Dennis Thayne ‚ÄúDJ‚Äù Rodman Jr. is an American college basketball player who is the son of NBA legend Dennis Rodman and his wife Michelle Moyer. He was born on 25 April 2001 in Newport Beach, California, United States and studied at JSerra Catholic High School. Rodman Jr. currently plays for the Washington State Cougars in the Pac-12 Conference.</p><p>Advertisement</p><h4><strong>Age and height</strong></h4><p>DJ Rodman is currently 22 years old and stands at a height of 1.98 m.</p><h4><strong>Siblings</strong></h4><p>DJ Rodman has two siblings named Trinity Rodman and Alexis Rodman. His sister Trinity Rodman is also a successful athlete, and plays as a forward for the Washington Spirit of the National Women‚Äôs Soccer League (NWSL). She also plays for the United States women‚Äôs national soccer team.</p><p>Trinity got selected in the 2021 NWSL College Draft and became youngest drafted player in NWSL history, while aged 18.</p><h4><strong>DJ Rodman career and stats</strong></h4><p>During his freshman season at Washington State, DJ rarely received any playing time. However, he got more playing time following Tony Miller‚Äôs ankle injury. He averaged around 1.7 points and 1.9 rebounds per game in his freshman season after the COVID-19 pandemic&nbsp; cut short the season.</p><p>As of the 2021-2022, which was his junior season, Rodman Jr. averaged 4.2 points and 4.1 rebounds per game. Meanwhile, in his current senior season, he has started 17 games and has so far averaged 9.6 points and 5.6 rebounds per game.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Based on his career stats, DJ has an overall field goal percentage of .404 and an average of 4.9 PPG. This is across 98 appearances, and he has also averaged 3.7 rebounds, 0.8 assists, and 0.6 steals per game.</p><p>Just recently, DJ Rodman scored 11 rebounds and 13 points, which is his first double-double of the season and the second of his career. He also has a .350 in 3-point field goal percentage and a .740 free throw percentage.</p><p>While his net worth isn‚Äôt known, his father Dennis Rodman is a retired American professional basketball player, actor and political diplomat who has a net worth of $500 thousand dollars.</p><h4><strong>Room for improvement</strong></h4><p>Although DJ Rodman shows a lot of promise and stands almost two meters tall, he still has room for improvement. Rodman still needs to work on various aspects of his game like tenacity, defensive work, and overall physicality.</p><p>Rodman is very different from his father Dennis Rodman as a player as shown in his statistics. Moreover, he needs to improve his shooting skills in order to become an NBA prospect. Since he is currently 21 years old, he had the option of trying out for the NBA draft since 2021.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>However, DJ has instead chosen to train harder and work on improving his game. DJ is unlikely to play at the same level as his father did but still has potential to become a decent NBA player.</p><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>ALSO READ: How much will Man City get in prize money if they win the treble and 2023 odds</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJrAsbvRraqgqpGeuW%2BvzqZmsKCfYra0ecOjZKunlKKur3nSqKVmp5Zisaa6zaKqZqqfmbqiuoyboKhlkZyybrTEop6hrF2lrrOxza2qZpyRmXquu9OhnKtlo6mutb%2BMp5ytZaekv7W0jg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./chris-kamara-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Chris Kamara Net Worth : Charity &amp;amp; Career</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./karrueche-tran-halloween-costume-lara-croft-pic.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>See Her Sexy Lara Croft Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carson-daly.html>Carson Daly - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Nationality, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-the-mike-tyson-vs-jake-paul-fight-the-most-hyped-sporting-event-of-2024.html>Is the Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul Fight the Most Hyped Sporting Event of 2024?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-are-the-top-highest-paid-college-athletes-in-2023.html>Who are the top highest paid college athletes in 2023?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-can-i-watch-the-ncaa-football-championship-2024.html>How can I watch the NCAA football Championship 2024?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sheryl-lee-ralph.html>Sheryl Lee Ralph Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
