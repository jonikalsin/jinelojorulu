Was It Constipation?</h2><p>Elvis has died, and it is common death. He was sitting on a toilet and forced to firm bowel movements and maneuvers that had put massive pressure on his heart and aorta. He died of a heart attack and fainted on the floor as of&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>pbs.org</a>.</p><p>He suffered from garden-variety constipation at the time of his death, and his chest got filled with amber-colored, white-topped vials of medications in doses that no professional doctors had prescribed him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.mixedarticle.com/uploads/2022/6/28ad7c84-3827-49af-ade3-5573f3372f91.webp><p>Elvis was dubbed the King of Rock and Roll and regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century.</p><h2 id=reddit-elvis-autopsy-report>Reddit: Elvis Autopsy Report</h2><p>Elvis got addicted to all kinds of pills with the help of several doctors whose ethics got swayed by the thousands of dollars in gifts that Elvis put upon them. He started taking the treatment in 1967 with Dr. George C. Nichopoulos, best known as Dr. Nick. The doctor took her full-time job in 1970.</p><p>The doctor has prescribed an average of 25 pills per day for his most famous patient after the star’s death.
