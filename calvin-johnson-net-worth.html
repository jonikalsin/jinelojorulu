class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Calvin Johnson Jr. was <a href=# rel="noopener external noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_Johnson data-lasso-id=101469 data-wpel-link=external>born on September 29th, 1985</a>, to Calvin Johnson Sr. and Arica Johnson in Newnan, Georgia.</p><p>As a child, Johnson’s parents pushed him to succeed in school, requiring him to keep A’s and B’s if he wanted to play sports.</p><p>By middle school, Calvin was already 6ft tall, growing to be 6ft 4in by his sophomore year in high school.</p><p>At Sandy Creek High School, Calvin was a football and baseball standout and was rated in the top 10 of all wide receivers in the nation.</p><p>For college, Calvin opted to attend the Georgia Institute of Technology, where he played for the Yellow Jackets football team from 2004 to 2006.</p><p>Johnson set many school records during his college career, including the most receiving yards and most receiving touchdowns for a career.</p><p>In 2007, Johnson declared himself eligible for the upcoming NFL draft, and he was ultimately chosen by the Detroit Lions in the first round as their second pick.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=career></span>Career&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Calvin Johnson signed a six-year contract with the Detroit Lions in 2007, and while they aren’t one of the <a href=# rel=noopener data-cke-saved-href=https://wealthygorilla.com/richest-nfl-teams/ data-lasso-id=101470 data-wpel-link=internal>richest NFL teams</a>, he became the highest-paid player in the team’s history.</p><p>During his first year, he received the nicknames “Megatron” and “Bolt” due to his towering size and impressive speed, which surprised many people.</p><p>Johnson played exceptionally well during his first couple of seasons with the Lions, but 2011 was his best statistical season by far.</p><p>During 2011, Johnson reached a career-high 1,681 receiving yards and 16 touchdowns and earned third place on the Top 100 NFL Players list.</p><p>In 2012, Johnson renewed his contract with the Detroit Lions for eight years and beat out Cam Newton to become the cover athlete for Madden NFL 13.</p><p>By the 2013 season, Johnson hit another career high of 329 receiving yards during a single game and earned a place on the Pro Bowl team, though an injury forced him to back out.</p><p>Johnson later became the fastest player to achieve 11,000 receiving yards during his 127th game in 2015, and while he was once again nominated to the Pro Bowl, he declined to attend.</p><p>In March of 2016, Johnson announced his decision to retire from the NFL, with his overall 5,137 receiving yards being the most earned by any player in a three-year period in NFL history.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=calvin-johnsons-career-earnings></span>Calvin Johnson’s Career Earnings<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While he may not be one of the <a
