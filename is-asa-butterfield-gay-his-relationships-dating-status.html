Or, he is at least not in the Prime Video Comedy Your Christmas or Mine?. Unlike his award-winning/everyone’s favorite character Otis Milburn in&nbsp;Sex Education, Asa is for the first time doing a Christmas-themed movie.</p><p>Having said that let us now discuss the&nbsp;British Independent Film Awards-winning English actor’s relationship history, current dating status, and more.</p><h3><strong>Is Asa Butterfield Gay?</strong></h3><p>A group of fans would not stop calling Asa Butterfield “gay beautiful” and a “gay sex symbol” despite him denying it time and again. So, no! Asa Butterfield is not gay but straight by sexuality.</p><p>In the meantime, one can tell that these gay rumors are mostly the result of his portrayal in&nbsp;Sex Education, the gay love triangle of his character, and his best friend Eric. But, even in the series, Asa’s character is straight.</p><h3><strong>Asa Butterfield Dating Status</strong></h3><p>Asa Butterfield was reportedly single at the time of this writing. Nevertheless, because he admitted he is a notoriously private person, so he may also be dating in private, away from prying eyes or media and the public.</p><p>In a recent GQ interview, when he was questioned “Your fans are obsessed with asking if you’re single. Do you want to answer that?”, he said he would not want to answer that. He responded that he would rather keep them guessing.</p><p>Even on social media, Asa did not give away any clue about his girlfriends. Yet, he does not shy away from showing his love for his cat, who he regularly posts snaps of on Instagram.</p><h3><strong>Asa Butterfield Relationships</strong></h3><p>In the past though, Asa seemed to have had a pretty busy dating life. He was linked to actress Hailee Steinfield in 2015 when they worked in Ten Thousand Saints together. Yet, at the time of this writing Hailee, like Asa, appeared single. She was previously linked romantically to Cameron Smoller and Niall Horan.</p><p>That same year, he openly dated Ella Purnell who he met on the set of Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children. They appeared loved up and seemed to be enjoying the holidays. But after a year of dating, they decided to separate. After Asa, the Maleficient&nbsp;actress started dating Max Bennett Kelly, a musical artist.&nbsp;<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span id=div-gpt-ad-liverampup_com-medrectangle-3-0 class="ezoic-ad ezfound" data-google-query-id=CIerpIy5lPwCFUXEjwodmpAHWQ></span></p><p>As for Asa, did he move on with Mimi Keene? The exciting on-screen chemistry between Asa’s character and Mimi’s Ruby in the third series Sex Education, plus the cute snaps of them hanging out in real life led a lot of people to speculate romance between the two. But, now it seems, the pair were just always “flirty friends”.</p><p>Many people also shipped Asa and Emma Mackey so hard because their chemistry as Otis and Maeve respectively was on another level. But, no. They also never dated IRL.</p><p>Another rumor that Asa met with was with the Vampire Diaries actress Nina Dobrev, i.e., since they worked together in the&nbsp;movie Then Came You.</p><p>Both these once-alleged girlfriends of Asa have already been taken. Emma has been dating the UK-based actor Dan Whitlam. Nina also has gotten pretty serious about her whirlwind romance with Shaun White.</p><h3><strong>How Old Is Asa Butterfield?</strong></h3><p>Asa Butterfield was born on 1 April 1997. So, he turned 25 years old in 2022.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Asa Butterfield’s Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>Asa Butterfield reportedly had more than&nbsp;$7 net worth as of 2022.</p><p>In April 2019, he told cntraveler.com, that he has got his own place in Hackney at that time around.</p><p>Asa, represented by&nbsp;Independent Talent, continues to live through his success days as he recently completed filming Billy Rubin in Flux Gourmet, James is&nbsp;Your Christmas or Mine?, and Isaac in Choose or Die.</p><p>The young actor started acting at age seven at the Young Actors Theatre Islington. Later, he landed minor roles in the 2006 television drama After Thomas and the 2007 film Son of Rambow. The next year, he received tremendous recognition as he played Bruno, the young German boy in the historical drama film The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas.</p><p>Then, when he turned 13, Asa played the main and title character in Hugo, adapted from the novel The Invention of Hugo Cabret. Hugo achieved critical success and so did Asa’s performance. He even won the Young Hollywood Awards in the “Breakthrough Performance – Male” category.</p><h3><strong>Asa Butterfield Height</strong></h3><p>Striking blue-eyed Asa Butterfield stands around 6′ (1.83 meters) in height.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Was Asa Butterfield Born?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Asa was born in Islington, London, England.
