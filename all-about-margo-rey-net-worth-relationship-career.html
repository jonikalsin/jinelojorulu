Ethnicity, Nationality, Family, Education</span></h2><p>Margo Rey was born in Acapulco, Mexico, on October 18, 1966, to Flamenco dancer Juana-Amparo Jurado and cliff diver Alejandro Reymundo.</p><p>She relocated to Fort Worth, Texas, with her parents and four brothers (including brother comedian Alex Reymundo) when she was two years old. Rey’s personal life revolved around her marriage to prominent comedian/actor Ron White from 2013 to 2017. Rey is a breast cancer survivor who routinely raises donations for non-profit organizations committed to the research of women’s disease.</p><p>Margo Rey’s career in show business began when she was a teenager and became the main vocalist in the all-female rock band Debutante. She and her colleagues traveled widely around the United States and self-released their CD ‘These Boots Were Made For Walkin’.</p><p>Rey then began singing with the power-pop band The Ritual. Sambuca, a Dallas venue, hired her when it disbanded. Miss Margo & The Lost Souls, a Latin Jazz/R&B sextet, was formed soon after.</p><h2><span id=Quick_Facts>Quick Facts</span></h2><p>Birth Date: October 18, 1966</p><p>Birth Place: Acapulco, Mexico</p><p>Country: Mexico</p><p>Gender: Female</p><p>Marital Status: Single</p><p>Eye Color: Dark Brown Eyes</p><h2><span id=Is_ABC_Single_Relationship>Is ABC Single?

Margo is a Grammy Award-winning singer who has collaborated with Buju Banton and Marc Anthony. According to Rey, the pair married in a secret ceremony in Texas in 2013. They’ve been living together ever then, even after moving to California. Despite this, Ron White refuses to recognize that they are husband and wife under Common Law. There are no children for the pair.</p><h2><span id=How_did_ABC_start_her_Professional_Career>How did ABC start her Professional Career?</span></h2><p>The group’s debut album, titled ‘Acaba,’ had one number-five and two number-twenty hits. The album’s success prompted the Mexican vocalist to earn a significant record deal with PolyGram Latino in 1997. As a result, she was placed in a significant part in the Broadway musical ‘Selena Forever’ in the late 1990s. During this time, she traveled to Los Angeles and was eventually signed by Abrams Artist Agency. Rey went on to do voiceover work for both Spanish and English firms in a range of commercials. ‘My Heart’s Desire,’ her debut album, was released in 2009.</p><p>There were also other hits on the album, including “My Heart’s Desire,” “Between Us,” “You Belong to Me,” and “Couldn’t Be More Wrong.”</p><p>Her future husband Ron White and music producer Michael Blakey discovered her and signed her to their Organica Music Group. Her original dance EP, ‘Habit (Remixes),’ began at number seven and swiftly rose to number one. The EP’s lead track, “Let the Rain,” which Rey and John Oates co-wrote, peaked at #17 on Billboard’s Adult Contemporary chart. Furthermore, the radio single “Between Us” reached #21 on the same list.</p><p>In 2011, the Mexican singer-songwriter dubbed ‘This Holiday Night’ published a Christmas EP.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read, Aeko Catori Brown, Jordana Lajoie, and Cogeian Sky Embry."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1053569,"3":{"1":0},"10":2,"11":0,"12":0,"15":"Arial","23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":0}}}{"1":28}{"1":30,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":0}}}{"1":44}{"1":50,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":0}}}{"1":67}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/aeko-catori-brown/"}{"1":28}{"1":30,"2":"https://popularbio.com/jordana-lajoie/"}{"1":44}{"1":50,"2":"https://popularbio.com/cogeian-sky-embry/"}{"1":67}'>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Aeko Catori Brown</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Jordana Lajoie</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Cogeian Sky Embry</a>.</span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Actress</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Matt Lucas Is Replaced By Alison Hammond As Co-Host</a></h3>Matt Lucas will be replaced by Alison Hammond as co-host of The Great British Bake Off.
