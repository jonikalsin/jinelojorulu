It confers nothing other than superficial celebrity clout and social media clicks.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Just because one may disagree with the outcome of a Supreme Court ruling, does not make it a threat to democracy.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>If Harry ever voted in an U.S. election, maybe he would have known that. But of course, he hasn’t because he is not a citizen.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The Supreme Court decision overturning Roe and returning the power to determine abortion policy to the states is not a threat to democracy – that is democracy in action.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But this isn’t the first time that Harry has exhibited a complete misunderstanding of the civic life of the country in which he now lives.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I’ve got so much I want to say about the First Amendment as I sort of understand it, but it is bonkers,’ he blathered on a podcast last year.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I don’t want to start going down the First Amendment route because that’s a huge subject and one which I don’t understand because I’ve only been here a short time, but you can find a loophole in anything.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>That’s right Harry. Maybe you shouldn’t be talking about the First Amendment or any amendment for that matter.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The exhausting thing about Harry is that it seems like all the Duke does in America is virtue-signal, lecture and deride the Constitution.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Harry and Meghan Markel chose to seek woke-asylum here in the United States because — as they infamously told the world — the Royal family was just too racist to endure.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>So, they fled the horrors of pampered royal life to live a pampered celebrity life in a sprawling multimillion dollar mansion, surrounded by the wealthiest and woke-est our country has to offer.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Maybe he needs reminding that he is a guest here and not a guest who has been universally embraced by the American public.</p><img decoding=async id=i-b17d8548b1fcd69d src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/07/18/22/58627687-11025959-A_bombshell_new_book_claims_that_the_Queen_told_her_closest_aide-a-5_1658179730432.jpg height=440 width=634 alt="Harry and Meghan Markel chose to seek woke-asylum here in the United States because -- as they infamously told the world -- the Royal family was just too racist to endure.
