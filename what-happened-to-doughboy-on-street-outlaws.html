He stopped updating his social media.</p><p>Fans want to know: what happened to Doughboy on Street Outlaws? Here’s the answer.</p><h2><strong>Who is Doughboy on Street Outlaws?</strong></h2><p>Doughboy is the son of Street Outlaws Memphis big boss man, Jonathan Day—AKA JJ Da Boss.</p><p>And no, Tricia “Midget” Day is not his mom—JJ’s wife is actually 10 years younger than he is, and was only 7 years old when JJ welcomed his first child with someone else.</p><p>Doughboy was born on December 31, 1990, in his dad’s hometown outside Memphis, Tennessee.</p><p>He is the oldest of JJ’s 11 children, and his real name is Joshua Day.</p><p>He married his wife, fellow street racer Chelsea, in September of 2015, and the pair have two children—a son named Kamden and a daughter named Novaleigh.</p><p>Doughboy first appeared on Street Outlaws: Memphis in only its second episode, and he rapidly amassed some die-hard fans.</p><p>In mid-2021, those fans noticed that Doughboy wasn’t on the show anymore.</p><p>Tracking his social media, it appeared that he hadn’t even posted on Instagram since April of 2019.</p><p>While the show must go on, Doughboy didn’t appear in the next 12 episodes until 2022.</p><h2><strong>What happened to Doughboy from Street Outlaws?</strong></h2><p>Doughboy Day’s absence from the hit Discovery show throughout season 5 generated a lot of attention and led to some pretty unhappy viewers.</p><p>The cast, crew, and show producers remained tight-lipped on Doughboy’s whereabouts, leading fans to speculate that something terrible had happened.</p><p>Viewers also drew attention to the fact that in show footage and social media posts by the Street Outlaws: Memphis crew, Doughboy’s wife, Chelsea, and the pair’s two children are often around.</p><p>The trio appear to spend a lot of time at JJ and Tricia’s home—but Doughboy is never in the shots.</p><p>When news surfaced that Chelsea and their children were living with JJ Da Boss and Tricia, fans became even more suspicious.</p><p>Theories were varied—with many fans on Reddit suggesting that Doughboy was possibly in jail following some earlier legal issues. One user set the record straight on that theory, explaining that “<a href=# rel=noopener>you can check the jail records and he’s not in jail</a>.”</p><p>Others thought the legal issues he had previously referred to were following the often circulated Cali fight, in which Doughboy appeared to play a major role. After this, the theory was that Discovery / Pilgrim did not want him on the show.</p><p>Due to contractual obligations, this also meant he could not be shown in any social media channels endorsed by the show—like other cast members’ Instagram feeds, for example.</p><p>As a long-time member of the larger Day family—and Precious Cooper’s sister—Chelsea continues racing and is involved with the rest of the crew.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Albert DePrisco Net Worth</a></p><h2><strong>Where is Doughboy from Street Outlaws, really?</strong></h2><p>Possibly tiring of all the gossip that detracted from the Street Outlaws: Memphis show—and the racing itself—JJ Da Boss eventually explained in a video excerpt that Doughboy was having back trouble.</p><p>He explained that Doughboy had an injured disk in his back.</p><p>Given that the eldest of the Day children had sustained serious injuries in a car accident back in season 2 of the show, it might make sense that he is currently out of action.</p><p>As if to confirm this, some fans noted that they spotted Doughboy at the end of season 5, episode 7, in the background.</p><p>This has not been confirmed by show execs but it goes a long way to dispelling some of the rumors going around.</p><h2 style=text-align:center><strong>READ THIS NEXT:</strong></h2><p style=text-align:center><a href=#>What is JJ and precious relationship</a>?</p><p style=text-align:center><a href=#>What is Willy McQuillian’s net worth</a>?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaK8tr%2FPnqappJWpvKWt2GeaqKVfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSdp6WctaO72Gamp2Wjqb%2BmsdNmpq6snJbEtHs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tameka-kute.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>At Age 26, Lil Durk Is A Father Of Six Children and Expecting Another One!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sam-cochrane.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sam Cochrane</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carson-daly.html>Carson Daly - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Nationality, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-the-mike-tyson-vs-jake-paul-fight-the-most-hyped-sporting-event-of-2024.html>Is the Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul Fight the Most Hyped Sporting Event of 2024?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-are-the-top-highest-paid-college-athletes-in-2023.html>Who are the top highest paid college athletes in 2023?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-can-i-watch-the-ncaa-football-championship-2024.html>How can I watch the NCAA football Championship 2024?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sheryl-lee-ralph.html>Sheryl Lee Ralph Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
