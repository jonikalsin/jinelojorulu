His first win at the famed tournament was topped off by a big congratulations from his gorgeous wife, <strong>Kelley Cahill</strong>. The gorgeous mother of his two young sons has been by his side since college and all during his hunt for the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>elusive green jacket</a><span>.</span>&nbsp;Let’s learn more about Kelley, below.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Jon-Rahm-Wife-Kelley-Cahill-ss-embed-1-1.jpg><h2>Kelley Met Jon In College When He Had ‘No Money’</h2><p id=content-paragraph-3>Back in 2019, Jon spoke to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Golf Digest</a> about the start of his romance with Kelley, which began at Arizona State together. The pair were both athletes when they struck up a conversation that led to a date, where Jon had to make do on a college student budget.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“I had no money, I was living on a couple hundred bucks a month at most, so I had a budget,” Jon said of the first time out with Kelley, where he said they stopped by a dive bar for margaritas and tacos. “But we have some disagreement about this—we don’t know if that was our first official date, or if it was at a football game”.</p><h2>Jon Designed Kelley’s Engagement Ring</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>When Jon popped the question to Kelley in 2018, his involvement was more than just getting down on one knee: he designed the gigantic engagement ring! “She wanted to pick the diamond, but I knew what I wanted,” Rahm explained to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Golf Magazine</a>.<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;</a>“I designed what’s around the ring. It’s supposed to look like a crown and an engraving inside. I had a big part in it. It wasn’t exactly what she wanted, but she loves it. It’s a little more personal like that.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>The couple would exchange vows in Spain on December 13, 2019.</p><h2>Kelley & Jon’s First Son Was Born Amid The Masters</h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>The pair announced in November 2020 that they were expecting their first child. The due date was actually supposed to coincided with Jon’s run at The Masters, with Jon telling <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Golf Digest</a>, “If anybody’s thinking of a betting on me on the Masters, maybe think about it twice because there’s a chance I have to just turn around and leave that week.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Fortunately, the baby boy came a week early. “Kepa Cahill Rahm, was born 4/3/21 at 12:15am.” Jon wrote on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>. “Momma Kelley is doing great and recovering. Kepa is also in great health. He is 7.2 lb and 20.5inch, big boy from the Basque Country. Without a doubt the greatest day of my life!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Jon often shares photos of his family, including his wife, to his Instagram. Kelley’s <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> was set to private at the time of publication.</p><h2 class=o-CustomRTE>Jon Apologized to Kelley For Calling Their Son A ‘Souvenir’</h2><p id=content-paragraph-14>Jon was asked if he had a souvenir outside from the Memorial Tournament trophy for his first time rising to No. 1. back in July 2020. “I do. His name is Kepa,” Rahm said, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Golf Digest</a>. “He’s almost two years old. Sorry, Kelley, but yeah. She can tell you the story more than me. We suspect that it was that night. Sorry,” Rahm added, cheekily suggesting Kepa was conceived at that time.</p><h2>Kelley & Jon Surprised Kepa With A Baby Brother</h2><p id=content-paragraph-17>The cute couple would go on to welcome a second son, <strong>Eneko</strong>, in August 2022. “Eneko Cahill Rahm born on August 5th, feeling grateful for another healthy boy! Kelley, Eneko and big brother Kepa are all doing great,” Jon said on Instagram. “We have had an amazing last few days soaking in these amazing moments as a family of four. Now time for the playoffs!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8mopWaqkZ26bsPIn5xmbWBrhnl8kWg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./big-booty-judy-net-worth-bio.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Big Booty Judy Net Worth Jesseca Dupart Net Worth | Big Booty Judy Bio, Age, Husband, Daughter,</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./aidan-hutchinson.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Aidan Hutchinson</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carson-daly.html>Carson Daly - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Nationality, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-the-mike-tyson-vs-jake-paul-fight-the-most-hyped-sporting-event-of-2024.html>Is the Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul Fight the Most Hyped Sporting Event of 2024?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-are-the-top-highest-paid-college-athletes-in-2023.html>Who are the top highest paid college athletes in 2023?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-can-i-watch-the-ncaa-football-championship-2024.html>How can I watch the NCAA football Championship 2024?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sheryl-lee-ralph.html>Sheryl Lee Ralph Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
