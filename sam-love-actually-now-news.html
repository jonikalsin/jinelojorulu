One of the love stories in the holiday-themed rom-com, which has become a seasonal classic since its release in 2003, centers school-aged Sam, who experiences his first major crush when he falls for his classmate Joanna (<strong>Olivia Olson</strong>) and embarks on a plan to win her heart with the help of his dad, recent widower Daniel (<strong>Liam Neeson</strong>). And while fans of the ensemble romance will likely always remember him most for being the adorable budding musician, Brodie-Sangster is now 32 years old and has a ton of other things going for him. Here's what he's been up to since making that flip past airport security.</p><p><strong>READ THIS NEXT:&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>See Paolo From Friends Now at 59</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Thomas-Brodie-Sangster-in-2003.jpg><p>Prior to Love Actually, Brodie-Sangster had already appeared in several TV movies, but the rom-com was his breakout role. Since then, he's appeared in dozens of movies and TV shows. On the big screen, the actor has had roles in Nanny McPhee, Tristan & Isolde, Bright Star, and The Maze Runner series. On TV, Brodie-Sangster made guest appearances in episodes of&nbsp;Doctor Who,&nbsp;Lewis, and&nbsp;Accused. He had a recurring role in Seasons 3 and 4 of&nbsp;Game of Thrones&nbsp;as Jojen Reed and starred in the miniseries&nbsp;Wolf Hall,&nbsp;Godless, and 2022's&nbsp;Pistol. His most well-known role in recent years is likely playing Benny Watts in&nbsp;The Queen's Gambit, though he also reprised the part of Sam for the 2017 Red Nose Day special,&nbsp;Red Nose Day Actually.</p><p>Brodie-Sangster is also a voice actor, known best for voicing characters in&nbsp;Phineas and Ferb and&nbsp;Thunderbirds Are Go.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Thomas-Sangster-in-2009.jpg><p>Brodie-Sangster told The Guardian&nbsp;last year that he took <a rel="noopener noreferrer external nofollow" href=#>a two-year break from acting</a> prior to The Queen's Gambit, mostly because he had been working steadily since he was a small child. "There was nothing else I wanted to do day in, day out. I just fancied slowing down for a bit, figuring out how to move forward," he said. "I didn't want acting to become a habit." The British actor added that he wasn't concerned about the offers drying up when he decided to come back. "If that happens, that happens. I'll find something else to do," he explained. "But it could definitely happen. People get forgotten and things move on; cultures change in the film industry."</p><p><strong>For more celebrity updates sent right to your inbox,&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>sign up for our daily newsletter</a>.<br></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Thomas-Brodie-Sangster-in-2022.jpg><p>Brodie-Sangster also told The Guardian that,&nbsp;while he's done plenty of other things, he doesn't mind being known as "the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external nofollow" href=#>Love Actually kid</a>" to many fans.<span aria-hidden=true>ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb</span></p><p>"If I got annoyed about it every time, I'd spend a lot of my life that way," he said. "It's something I'm really proud of. It's cool to be in a film that's somehow still gaining momentum. It did quite well but it wasn't a huge blockbuster. But over the years it's gained that cult following."</p><p>Still, fame can show up in strange ways. The actor added later in the interview that he's seen bedsheets with his face on them, which was a bit of a trip.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Tallulah-Riley-and-Thomas-Brodie-Sangster-in-2022.jpg><p>In March of this year, Brodie-Sangster and <a rel="noopener noreferrer external nofollow" href=#>girlfriend <strong>Talulah Riley</strong></a> made their red carpet debut as a couple at the British Academy Film Awards Gala Dinner. Riley is an actor as well; she's appeared in Pride & Prejudice and Westworld, and co-starred with Brodie-Sangster in Pistol, playing designer <strong>Vivienne Westwood</strong>. Her other claim to fame is that she was married—twice—to Tesla CEO&nbsp;<strong>Elon Musk</strong>. The pair split for good in 2016.</p><p>Riley and Brodie-Sangster reportedly met filming&nbsp;Pistol&nbsp;and began dating a few months before going public. Riley often shares shots of the two of them <a rel="noopener noreferrer external nofollow" href=#>on Instagram</a> and documents the events they attend together.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBrbXFnqanpJmjsm%2BvzqZmrJmdYrmwwsRmmJyspZa5rcWMp6awZZ6axLR7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-does-the-big-4-mean-in-tennis.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Does &amp;quot;The Big 4&amp;quot; Mean in Tennis?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tameka-kute.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>At Age 26, Lil Durk Is A Father Of Six Children and Expecting Another One!</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carson-daly.html>Carson Daly - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Nationality, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-the-mike-tyson-vs-jake-paul-fight-the-most-hyped-sporting-event-of-2024.html>Is the Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul Fight the Most Hyped Sporting Event of 2024?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-are-the-top-highest-paid-college-athletes-in-2023.html>Who are the top highest paid college athletes in 2023?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-can-i-watch-the-ncaa-football-championship-2024.html>How can I watch the NCAA football Championship 2024?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sheryl-lee-ralph.html>Sheryl Lee Ralph Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
