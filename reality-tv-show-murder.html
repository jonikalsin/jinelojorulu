When the would-be predators arrived, TV personality Chris Hansen was there with a full camera crew and a real-life police squad to detain them.</p><p>On November 5, 2006, <a href=#>Louis William “Bill” Conradt, Jr.</a> became inextricably linked to the show when local law enforcement conducted a sting in Texas, where he was a practicing Assistant District Attorney.</p><p>Conradt was caught soliciting minors for sex online, but when SWAT team members arrived at his home to serve the arrest warrant, Conradt shot himself.</p><p>The show continued for a year after, with Conradt’s family settling quietly out of court.</p><h2>Megan Wants To Marry A Millionaire</h2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAHr8ipBtnM</p><p>Attempting to seize on the success of VH1’s Rock Of Love With Bret Michaels, the network debuted Megan Wants A Millionaire in 2009. The show followed the life of Megan Hauserman, a one-time Rock of Love contestant who claimed that her ultimate goal was to become a trophy wife.</p><p>In the series, VH1 asked single men with a net worth of more than $1 million to compete for the young reality star’s love. Shortly after its August 2, 2009 premiere, however, the show was abruptly canceled. A grisly murder-suicide involving contestant Ryan Jenkins, a Canadian real estate investor and contestant, had been discovered.</p><p>Jenkins, who was rumored to have placed third in the show, married swimsuit model Jasmine Fiore shortly after the show’s premiere — and in less than 48 hours of knowing her.</p><p>The model from Santa Cruz, California was discovered on August 15, 2009, strangled and stuffed into a suitcase. Her remains were so mutilated that only the serial numbers on her breast implants enabled her identification.</p><p>Jenkins was the only suspect in the case and was immediately charged with the murder. He would never face a courtroom, however. On August 23, 2009, Jenkins was found hanging in a Canada hotel room. Police later found <a href=#>a suicide note</a> on his computer hard drive.</p><p>The murder-suicide prompted an immediate cancellation of the series. Hauserman went on to reveal in <a href=#>a People magazine article</a> her fear that she could have been Jenkins’ next victim.</p><p>Next, check out how the <a href=#>Slender Man myth led people to kill</a>. Then, discover <a href=#>five criminals who say that popular works of fiction inspired their crimes</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyzscCloK2xXanDbr%2FHqK5mpaWnsaa%2Bjms%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bex-farleigh.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bex Farleigh</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./where-did-athing-mu-grow-up.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Where did Athing Mu grow up?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./carson-daly.html>Carson Daly - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Nationality, Facts</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-the-mike-tyson-vs-jake-paul-fight-the-most-hyped-sporting-event-of-2024.html>Is the Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul Fight the Most Hyped Sporting Event of 2024?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-are-the-top-highest-paid-college-athletes-in-2023.html>Who are the top highest paid college athletes in 2023?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-can-i-watch-the-ncaa-football-championship-2024.html>How can I watch the NCAA football Championship 2024?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./sheryl-lee-ralph.html>Sheryl Lee Ralph Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingX.
